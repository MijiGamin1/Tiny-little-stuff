Hello! This is just a mass repository to store all the tiny little stuff that I made but didn't feel deserved it's own repository.
The name itself is a reference to Logan Whitehurst and the Junior Science Club's album, "Very Tiny Songs."

What everything does:

owoify: Turns inputted text into OwO furry text and copies it to clipboard. "owoify-py.py" is the Python version.

factorer: Shows all possible factors of an inputted number.
