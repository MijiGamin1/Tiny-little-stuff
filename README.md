Hello! This is just a mass repository to store all the tiny little stuff that I made but didn't feel deserved it's own repository.
The name itself is a reference to Logan Whitehurst and the Junior Science Club's album, "Very Tiny Songs."

What everything does:

owoify: Turns inputted text into OwO furry text and copies it to clipboard. "owoify-py.py" is the Python version.

factorer: Shows all possible factors of an inputted number. "factorer-py.py" is the Python version, and purely text-based, while "factorer-html.html" is the HTML version, and has more of a graphical interface. "factorer-html.html" was made originally in Scratch, and converted over using SheepTester's "htmlifier".
